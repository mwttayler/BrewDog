BrewDog Android App
==================
A fully functional Android app built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose using the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2)

## Architecture
The app follows the [official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) and is modularised using Gradle modules. 
A domain layer has not been implmentented to reduce boilerplate code in the project however could be introduced in the future if circumstances call for it.
